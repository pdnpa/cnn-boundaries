# Define an annotation task
# This includes:

# 2. a list of labels to be used for this task
# ---------------------------------------
tasks:
  walls:
    labels: ["no_wall", "wall"]

# ---------------------------------------
# paths
# You need to specify:
# 1. a name (e.g., task_test_one_inch_maps_001, see below)
# 2. patch_paths: path to all the patches to be annotated
# 3. parent_paths: path to the original/parent maps/images (which were patchified)
# 4. annot_dir: directory in which the outputs will be stored
# ---------------------------------------
paths:
  task_test_OS_maps_001:
    patch_paths: "../content/tifs/patches/"
    parent_paths: "../content/tifs/masked/*.tif"
    annot_dir: "../content/annotations_1950/"
